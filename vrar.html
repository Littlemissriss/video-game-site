								  <h2>Virtual Reality AND aUGMENTED rEALITY, the future of gaming?</h2>
										<span class="byline"> By Gwendolyn Peterson</span>
								  </header>
                                <p>Virtual Reality(VR) is a concept that recently became a reality(no pun intended), where through technology our senses are immersed to the point that we can be placed in a different reality. When you are watching a movie, you can always look away from the screen. Even in 3D films and other forms of media are confined to screens and all their limits. VR aims to escape the confines of a traditional screen and allows you to place yourself in movies or games. Augmented Reality(AR) is the same thing, except instead of completely creating a digital world from scratch to place the user in, it projects things onto the reality we already possess. An example of VR would be TiltBrush, a program that allows you to draw a sculpture out of thin air in an empty void. Once you put on an HTC Vive (the VR headset TiltBrush runs on), you cannot see the room around you and instead see your void and the sculptures you draw. An example of AR would technically be the infamous Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go turns on your phone's camera, and projects a pokemon onto whatevever the camera is pointed at, allowing you to &quot;catch pokemon in real life&quot;. While this particular example is underwhelming, many are omptimistic for the potential of AR. Imagine if you could see your emails floating in front of you, or be in the same room with someone on the opposite side of the world?</p>
								  <p>	There are two overarching stances on Virtual Reality (and by extension Augmented Reality), both in the context of gaming and in wider contexts. Some think that VR and AR are the future of fill-in-the-blank. Gaming, movies, mobile technology, that kind of thing. Others claim that VR and AR are a fad that will die out eventually and will never live up to the hype they're given. Whether you are hoping for the days when everybody has a personalized mounted headset like our smartphones today or waiting for more practial and sustainable innovation to replace the excitement, it's undeniable great strides have been made in virtual reality and augmented reality alike, especially over the past several years.</p>
								  <p>Virtual Reality started long before most of us would imagine. In 1962, Morton Heilig created a machine dubbed &quot;the Sensorama Simulator&quot;, a device invented indeed before digital computing was born. It used mechanical machinery to create sight, sound, smell and even touch(if you consider wind) once you sat down and stuck your head in. Whether this counted as true VR depends on your definition of VR, but this effort has been going a long time.</p>
								  <p>Where this effort has lead us pertaining to gaming is the afformentioned HTC Vive, the latest and arguably greatest of modern VR technology. Google and others have created small, easy-to-use headsets out of a head mount, an app and your smartphone, but those who have experienced both claim that those are nothing compared to the Vive. The Vive has a mounted immersive headset and a controller for each hand, which allows easier and better interaction with virtual worlds. While more ambitious projects are in development, the HTC Vive is a fully developed product that you can buy right now and have programs to run on. Although much excitement has been generated over the Vive's artistic capability (drawing, 3D sculpting, spraypainting and animating programs are all available for use), there has been a similar amount raised for the Vive's gaming potential. It has become a flagship both of what we already can do at the moment and what might happen in the future. Two of the most popular games exclusive to the vive are Job Simulator and The Lab (although there are others). Job simulator puts you down in a bright and cartoony universe where robots have replaced humans, but still work to preserve the history of the human lifestyle (albeit with a lot of humorous misunderstandings). In job simulator there are several minigames where you perform several modern day jobs, such as a car mechanic or a restaurant cook. The gameplay is simple, easy, and can be done in a very small area, but the experience and humor have made the game a hit. The lab is set in the universe of Valve's Portal and Portal 2. Although you aren't shooting and hopping through portals in this game, you do get to experience a cutscene where GLaDOS looms over you and a bunch of amazing simulation minigames that demonstrate VR's potential. Like angry birds? What if you could grab the projectile with your own two hands, physically heave yourself back and release said projectile into a warehouse of desctructable structures. You can, if you have $800 (plus whatever is required to upgrade your computer to run the programs) to spare!</p>
								  <p>Personally, I'm somewhat optimistic for the future of VR and eventually AR in gaming. We already have some amazing demos, and the HTC Vive is like a first generation iphone, or even flipphone. I don't think things like computers, phones, or TVs will go away soon, or at all, but given enough time we could all be walking around with an AR Headset like we all walk around with a smartphone. Many others would disagree with me though, if you are interested in this subject go do some google searching and youtube watching. Although mainstream VR and AR are extremely young, there is already a lot of stuff to nerd out over, too much to write here.							  </p>
